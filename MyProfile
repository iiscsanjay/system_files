r Sir,

I am working on python from last 3 years. I am building new framework for Sequence Alignment on Protein Databases.

I never worked on scrapy. I had worked on three project in my research life. 

1. Parallel Implementation of Smith-waterman Algorithms in C Language with Posix-threads.
2. Building New framework on HMMER to store result on Python
3. Parallel Implementation and doing statistical analysis on Biological database.
